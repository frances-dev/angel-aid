# Introduce My Angel-Aid Firebase App

This is a hospital related website called 'Angel Aid'. This project was made using Firebase User Authentication and also hosted on Firebase.(https://angle-aid.web.app/)

## Technologies used in this project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Responsive Ux/UI`

This Project was made responsive.

### `Using fake data by json file`

This project was solely made based on json files data which was dynamic. But there were static data too.

### `React Router`

React router is one of the most famous technology which helps to make a single page application using router which loads the page without loading. Sounds cool! Yes it is.

### `Private Route`

One of the most important thing we implemented in this Hospital related website is that it has private routing except for the home page. You have the sign in or register through firebase to access other pages which was a great technology to learn.

### `Making Hooks & Context API`

Making custom hooks and context api was also one of the most important thing we learned in this project which helps a developer to organize any react application.

### `Using Redirect`

Angel Aid website has also redirect option implemented. Please check by yourself.

### `Firebase Hosting`

This project was hosted on firebase. Thank you!!
